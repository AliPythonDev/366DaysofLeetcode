Problem Number: 1760 (https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-limit-of-balls-in-a-bag)
Date: 07-12-2024
Description:
You are given an integer array nums where the ith bag contains nums[i] balls. You are also given an integer maxOperations.
You can perform the following operation at most maxOperations times:
* Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.
    * For example, a bag of 5 balls can become two new bags of 1 and 4 balls, or two new bags of 2 and 3 balls.
Your penalty is the maximum number of balls in a bag. You want to minimize your penalty after the operations.
Return the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [9] -> [6,3].
- Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [6,3] -> [3,3,3].
The bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4. [2,4,8,2] -> [2,4,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,4,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,2,2,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].
The bag with the most number of balls has 2 balls, so your penalty is 2, and you should return 2.
 
Constraints:
* 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
* 1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 10^9

            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int ops = 0;
            for (int n : nums) if ((ops += (n - 1) / mid) > maxOps) break;
            ops <= maxOps ? high = mid : low = mid + 1;
